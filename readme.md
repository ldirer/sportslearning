A web application to explore statistics of a tennis game.

You can [try it here](http://sportslearning.herokuapp.com/tennis/) (login/pw Roger/Roger).  
A couple of warnings: the link above is in French, and design is mostly mine.


In the unlikely event that someone wants to look at the source code, it is *very* messy. 
You won't pick up a lot of best practices reading it. 

This was my first web application, built with Django, d3 and Bootstrap.
